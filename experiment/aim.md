### Aim of the Experiment

The aim of this experiment is to understand the fundamental programming constructs of Solidity smart contracts. This includes learning the syntax of Solidity, exploring **Mapping, Array, and Struct**, gaining initial exposure to transactions and gas fees, and applying these concepts by coding simple applications such as Car Rental, Land Buy/Sell, and KYC Verification for hands-on experience.
