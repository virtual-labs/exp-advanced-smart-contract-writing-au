<h3>Solidity</h3>
<p>
    Solidity is a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the most commonly used language for Ethereum development. Solidity is similar to JavaScript in terms of syntax and allows developers to define the logic and behavior of smart contracts.
</p>

<h4>Key Features of Solidity:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Smart Contract Design:</strong> Enables developers to create decentralized applications (DApps) and automated agreements.</li>
    <li><strong>Static Typing:</strong> Ensures that variable types are explicitly declared, improving code reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Event Logging:</strong> Facilitates communication with the front-end by logging events that can be captured.</li>
    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Allows code reuse and the creation of modular components.</li>
    <li><strong>Complex Data Structures:</strong> Supports arrays, mappings, and structs to handle sophisticated data requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Modifiers:</strong> Provides reusable logic for access control and validation in functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Generates Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) for seamless interaction with other Ethereum tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Structures in Solidity</h3>

<h4>1. Structs</h4>
<p>
    A <strong>struct</strong> in Solidity is a user-defined data type that allows grouping related variables. Structs are useful for creating complex data models within smart contracts.
</p>
<pre><code>
struct Person {
    string name;
    uint age;
}
</code></pre>

<h4>2. Arrays</h4>
<p>
    Solidity supports both static and dynamic arrays. Arrays store multiple values of the same data type.
</p>
<pre><code>
// Dynamic array
uint[] public numbers;

// Static array
uint[5] public fixedNumbers;
</code></pre>

<h4>3. Mappings</h4>
<p>
    A <strong>mapping</strong> is a key-value data structure that allows efficient data retrieval. It is commonly used for storing and looking up values, such as an address-to-balance mapping.
</p>
<pre><code>
mapping(string => uint) public ages;
</code></pre>

<h3>Remix IDE</h3>
<p>
    Remix IDE is a powerful development tool used for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. It is open-source and accessible as a web application or a desktop version.
