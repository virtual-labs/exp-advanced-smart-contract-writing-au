### Theory

Solidity is a high-level, contract-oriented programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It enables developers to define logic, rules, and data structures for decentralized applications (dApps). Its syntax is similar to JavaScript, making it 
accessible for developers with basic programming experience.

A **smart contract** is a self-executing program stored on the blockchain. Once deployed, it automatically executes predefined 
rules, enabling operations such as transactions, record-keeping, and data validation without intermediaries.  
In advanced smart contract development, data management is essential, and Solidity provides **mappings, arrays, and structs** to store and manipulate structured information effectively.



#### Hands-On Focus of This Experiment:
- **Mappings:**  
  Students will implement key–value data storage where values can be efficiently retrieved using unique keys (e.g., mapping student IDs to details).  

- **Arrays:**  
  Students will declare and manipulate both fixed-size and dynamic arrays to store sequential data (e.g., maintaining a list of registered users).  

- **Structs:**  
  Learn to group multiple related variables into a single data type, allowing for complex data representation (e.g., storing student name, age, and grade in one struct).  

- **Integration of Data Structures:**  
  Students will combine mappings, arrays, and structs in practical contracts to handle real-world requirements.  

- **Practical Applications:**  
  - **Student Records Management** – add, update, and retrieve student information.  
  - **Voting System** – maintain voter details and track votes securely.  
  - **Asset Tracking** – register and transfer ownership of assets using mappings and structs.  


Students will use the **Remix IDE** to write, compile, deploy, and test their contracts in a simulated environment.  
This hands-on approach helps learners gain practical experience with Solidity programming and understand how advanced data structures can be applied in real blockchain applications.
