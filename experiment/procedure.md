### Procedure
In this simulation, we are exploring the Solidity compiler to perform simple tasks using Solidity and to learn and explore structs, arrays, and mappings.

1. **Create a Solidity File:**  
   To create a Solidity file, click on the icon indicated in the Remix IDE. When prompted, enter the desired filename with the extension `.sol`. Then, press **Control + Enter** to confirm.

2. **File Creation Confirmation:**  
   Once the file is successfully created, you will see it appear in the file explorer.


3. **Select a Tutorial:**  
   You can now observe three options indicating tutorials on **structs**, **arrays**, and **mappings**. Select one of the tutorials to learn the syntax.
