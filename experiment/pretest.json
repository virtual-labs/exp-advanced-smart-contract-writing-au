        "a": "Incorrect: A dynamic array doesn't have a fixed size.",
        "b": "Correct: A dynamic array can grow or shrink dynamically.",
        "c": "Incorrect: A dynamic array can store any supported data type, not just strings.",

        "a": "A data type to store single variables",

        "c": "A user-defined data type for grouping variables",
        "d": "A predefined library in Solidity"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect: Structs are used to group multiple variables, not single variables.",
        "b": "Incorrect: This describes inheritance, not structs.",
        "c": "Correct: A struct is a user-defined data type to group related variables.",

        "a": "Incorrect: Arrays store values sequentially, not in key-value pairs.",
        "b": "Incorrect: Structs group variables but don't use key-value pairs.",
